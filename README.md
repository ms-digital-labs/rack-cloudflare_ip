# Rack::CloudflareIp

Overwrites the `REMOTE_ADDR` HTTP header with the contents of
`CF_CONNECTING_IP` if it's present. This makes `request.ip` in
Rack return the IP of the user making the request rather than the IP of
a Cloudflare server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rack-cloudflare_ip'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-cloudflare_ip

## Usage
